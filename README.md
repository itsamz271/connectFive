# Connect Five

My Youtube Demonstration: https://youtu.be/LxJz2jAwcM0

## Description
This project involves the implementation of an Artificial Intelligence agent in a game of connect five. The game of connect five involves a grid where each player's piece is dropped from the top. The pieces stack over each other if dropped in the same colmun. To win the game, a player has to get five of its pieces adjacent to each other either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

The agent utilizes the alpha-beta algorithm (with MinMax) using multiple heuristics in order to make the best move.

## How to play:

Run the 'connectFour.java' file. The user will be prompted with the choice to play against A.I or with a person. If A.I is chosen, the user can choose if the Alpha-Beta algorithm of the Artificial Intelligence should be based with reference to the depth or the time. The higher the depth/time, the better the A.I

For depth (enter an integer value):
1 - Beginner
2 - Medium
3 - Challenging

To drop a piece, the user will have to enter the column in which he would like to drop the piece. However, the columns start with 0.
Hence, to drop the piece in the 1st column, enter '0'.
